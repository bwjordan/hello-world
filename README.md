# hello-world
Not sure where this will lead. Thinking this is a good place to advance my knowledge. 
I am very new to coding and have found many online tutorials. None seem to include "big picture" information. I sit for hours
on tutorials for python, html, etc. and seem to be lacking something. Maybe this is the way to learn...crawl before you walk. 
I have a very technical background and love solving problems. I'm just trying to wrap my head around this thing and have yet to find
a source of thorough knowledge.
